        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
  heading: What we offer
  description: >-
    Just recall some of the personal disappointments you have experienced. Now
    think about your bad habits that you may be ashamed to acknowledge.


    Even if you are not considered fat by others, it is human to be bothered by your weigh. We all fantasize about losing some weight, even if we don't obsess about it.


    Our biological wiring harbours emotional responses to override what we claim to control. Think about your tendency to eat too much, despite your commitment not to.


    Or, about getting angry when some idiot cuts you off in traffic. We all know these things happen all the time, but we take offence when 'we' get cut off. We forget about those times we have to be assertive, which may cut someone else off.


    Acknowledging these annoyances has negligible impact on our ability to change our behaviour. Are our innate impulses in charge?


    Our emotions seem to betray our common sense more often than we want to admit that it might.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
